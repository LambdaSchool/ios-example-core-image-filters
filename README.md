# Core Image Filters

This is a simple example repo meant to show basic filtering using Core Image.

**Please note that if you want to test this project yourself, you should run it on an actual iOS device, as the simulator cannot currently access your Mac's GPU to render the images as fast as is normally be possible on a real device.**
